Arduino Yun Snapshot Camera (Version 2)
==============================================================
Revision 2 of the Amazon Web Services integrated web camera, which now features the ability to return images captured through the recipients email, not to mention, provide web server functionality, allowing the device to be operated using a public IP address.

Arduino Source Code (Updated from Version 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------
To operate the device under it's new configuration, the updated .ino file found above within the 'snapshotCamera' folder needs to be uploaded to the Arduino, which will allow for it to listen in on incoming motion data, as well as any data sent through the client via the web server hosted on the Yun itself.
